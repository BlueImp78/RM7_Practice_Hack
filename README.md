# Rockman 7 Practice Hack

A practice oriented romhack for RM7 speedruns.
It has features such as all robot masters + wily stages available from the start, selectable categories,  reloading/advancing through checkpoints, and more. See below for full feature list.

## How to patch

- Using Lunar Expand (included), select  <strong>24Mbit (3 MB) </strong> and apply it to your vanilla Rockman 7 (J) ROM.
  
  After that, apply the .ips patch to your ROM with Lunar IPS (also included).
- Enjoy.


## Features

- The game's intro movie is skipped, and the title screen plays the song you'd hear if you watched it until the end.
  
- The title screen no longer fades out if you don't press anything for too long.
  
- Selectable categories in the title screen (Any%, Any% Spring QK or 100%)
  
- Stage select boss intros are skipped, faster transition into the stages.
  
- In the stage select, with the cursor on Wily, press L/R to choose which castle stage to go to, also has options for intro and museum (intro cutscene is skipped, museum cutscene with gutsman and wily is skipped).
Likewise for 100% route, with the cursor on shade, press L/R to swap between normal visit or revisit.

- Hold START when entering a stage to start at the boss corridor.
  
- After selecting a stage, weapons and items are appropriately set based on which ones you should have by that point in your chosen category.
  
- Infinite lives and tanks.
  
- EXIT item always enabled on every stage, including intro, museum, and Wily stages.
  
- Weapons refill on death/respawn.
  
- Faster death animation for Mega Man.
  
- Fanfare music and weapon get animations after beating a boss are skipped and Mega Man walks to the center of the room sooner.
  
- Dr.Light's lab cutscenes are skipped.
  
- NPC dialogue is skipped with the exception of Proto Man's in Turbo and Shade due to skipping them causing issues.
  
- Password screen is skipped.
  
- Castle cutscene when entering a Wily stage is skipped
  
- At any point in the stage, press A+X to respawn at your current checkpoint, or hold A+X then press Left/Right on the D-PAD to cycle to the previous/next checkpoint respectively. Note: doesn't work in the pause menu or if you don't have control of Mega Man (with the exception of the "READY" screen).
  
- For the 100% route, the Proto Man fight in the Shade Man stage is always enabled, and his flags for the visits in Cloud and Turbo are reset on death/respawn or if you leave the stage.
  
- The teleporters to the boss refights in Wily 4 never close and are always available to be re-entered.
  
- The last checkpoint in Wily 4 (before final boss) will start you with less health and W.Coil ammo (the amount you'd have in the run) to facilitate practicing Machine QK.
  
- After beating Wily Capsule, returns to stage select instead of triggering the ending/credits.
